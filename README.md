# ETHelper

### Intro
This project is a result of  Tenderly hackaton 2022. 
The main goal of the hackathon is to create an app that will lower down the gap for entering Web3 development.


### Target group
With our idea, we wanted to focus on developers who are currently introducing themselves with Solidity and help them better understand the language.

## Main idea
Our solution is Chrome Extension that allows you to pick Solidity keywords of your choice and with one click get transfered to the Solidity documentation page that explains the meaning of said keyword.

This is done by selecting your keyword of choice with mouse cursor and pressing CTRL+SHIFT+ALT. After you press the keys, Solidity documentation page with the right explanation will be opened in new tab. If however, you select a word that we can't find in the documentation, you will receive the message that asks you if you would like to search for the word yourself. By clicking "OK", you will be transfere to Solidity documentation page and your desired word will be searched in Solidity documentation search engine.

### Installation
Download this repository and add it to your Chrome extensions to Extensions > Manage extensions > Load unpacked

NOTE: Make sure that your Developer mode is enabled in Extensions > Manage extensions
