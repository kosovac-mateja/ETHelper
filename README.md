# ETHelper

### Intro
This project is a result of  Tenderly hackaton 2022. 
The main goal of the hackathon is to create an app that will lower down the gap for entering Web3 development.


### Target group
With our idea, we wanted to focus on developers who are currently introducing themselves with Solidity and help them better understand the language.

## Main idea
Our Chrome Extension allows you to easily find Solidity keywords in the documentation. With one click, you can go to the page that explains the meaning of the keyword you selected. If the word doesn't exist, you can search the dictionary for similar phrases. Additionally, our solution allows users to auto-complete some phrases for faster coding.  

This is done by selecting your keyword of choice with mouse cursor and pressing CTRL+SHIFT+ALT (Windows), or CONTROL+SHIFT+OPTION (Mac), After you press the keys, Solidity documentation page with the right explanation will be opened in new tab. If however, you select a word that we can't find in the documentation, you will receive the message that asks you if you would like to search for the word yourself. By clicking "OK", you will be transfere to Solidity documentation page and your desired word will be searched in Solidity documentation search engine.
